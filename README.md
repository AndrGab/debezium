## 🎓 Perfect for Learning Change Data Capture (CDC)!

This application is a **WebSocket-based FastAPI project** that demonstrates **real-time Change Data Capture (CDC)** using Debezium and Kafka. It's designed as an **educational resource** to help developers understand:

- 🔄 **Change Data Capture** fundamentals
- 📡 **Real-time data streaming** concepts  
- 🏗️ **Event-driven architecture** patterns
- 🔌 **WebSocket** implementations
- 📊 **Database replication** techniques

**Debezium** enables CDC to capture row-level changes in databases, allowing applications to respond to those changes instantly. This README provides installation, configuration, and usage details for the application.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Required to run containers for the application and associated services.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages the multi-container environment.
- **Bruno API Client** (optional): Used for creating and managing requests to Debezium connectors.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndrGab/debezium.git
   cd debezium
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Containers**:

   ```bash
   make build
   make up
   ```

   This builds the FastAPI application and starts PostgreSQL, Kafka, Zookeeper, Debezium Connect, and the FastAPI service, exposing configured ports for each service.

## Debezium Configuration

### 1. Change WAL Level in PostgreSQL

To enable logical replication, set the PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) level to `logical`:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical;
```

**Restart the database contains after system changes**

Verify the WAL level:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_settings WHERE name = 'wal_level';
```

### 2. Create the `super_heroes` Table

Run the following SQL commands in PostgreSQL to set up the `super_heroes` table for CDC:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.super_heroes (
    id serial4 NOT NULL,
    "name" varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    secret_identity varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    powers varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT super_heroes_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

Insert initial data:

```sql
INSERT INTO super_heroes ("name", secret_identity, powers)
    VALUES ('SuperMan', 'Clark Kent', 'flight, x-ray vision, strength, heat vision');
```

### 3. Set Replica Identity

Set the replica identity of the `super_heroes` table to `FULL` for Debezium to capture detailed row-level changes:

```sql
ALTER TABLE super_heroes REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

### 4. Create the Debezium Source Connector

Use a POST request (0.0.0.0:8083/connectors) to create a source connector for the `super_heroes` table. You can use [Bruno](https://usebruno.com) or another API client to send the following JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "source-connector-super-heroes",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
    "database.hostname": "tester_db",
    "database.port": "5432",
    "database.user": "postgres",
    "database.password": "postgres",
    "database.dbname": "postgres",
    "database.server.name": "postgres",
    "table.include.list": "public.super_heroes",
    "plugin.name": "pgoutput",
    "slot.name": "slotheroes",
    "topic.prefix": "cdc-using-debezium-super-heroes"
  }
}
```

## Application Configuration

Key configurations are located in `app/settings.py` and `pyproject.toml`, including:

- **Kafka Host and Topic**: Ensures alignment with Debezium's Kafka topics.
- **Server Metadata**: Customizable in `pyproject.toml` for project name, version, and contact information.

## Usage

1. **Access the Application**:

   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
   - Each client receives a unique ID and connects to a WebSocket to receive real-time messages.

2. **WebSocket Messaging**:
   - Clients connect via `/ws/{client_id}`.
   - Database events (create, update, delete) trigger notifications across connected clients.

## Features

- **Real-Time Database Monitoring**: Listens for PostgreSQL changes via Kafka and broadcasts them.
- **WebSocket Notifications**: WebSocket connections distribute messages to all connected clients.
- **User Interface**: Messages display in a chat interface with styles indicating operation type.
- **Educational Focus**: Perfect for learning CDC, event-driven architecture, and real-time data streaming.
